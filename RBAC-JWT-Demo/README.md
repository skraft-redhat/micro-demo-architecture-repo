|[RBAC with http Query Headers](http://www.orf.at)|This is the most basic module where the "role" is transferred as a Query Header. The server validates the role programmatically.|RestEasy Reactive,<br>RestEasy Client Reactive|<br>RestEasy Reactive||
|RBAC with Basic Authentication|The credentials are stored in a database. The client uses browser-based Basic Authentication. This is then propagated to the Server. |RestEasy Reactive,<br>RestEasy Client Reactive<br>For the connection with the database: Hibernate-orm-panache,<br>security-jpa,<br>jdbc-postgresql|RestEasy Reactive<br>For the connection with the database:<br>Hibernate-orm-panache,<br>security-jpa,<br>jdbc-postgresql|External database to store user credentials|
|RBAC with JWT|In order to establish trust, a JWT is used. This JWT can be created manually, programmatically (JWT Build) or automatically added in the header.|RestEasy Reactive,<br>Rest Client Reactive,<br>JWT BuildRestEasy Reactive,<br>JWT||
|RBAC with Keycloak, decentral enforcement|Keycloak acts as an intermediary to issue a JWT token. The server validates the token and enforces RBAC.|RestEasy Reactive,<br>RestEasy Client Reactive,<br>oidc-reactive-filter|resteasy reactive,<br>oidc|Keycloak|
|RBAC with Keycloak on OpenShift|This is the same scenario as above, deployed on OpenShift.|RestEasy Reactive,<br>RestEasy Client Reactive,<br>oidc-reactive-filter,<br>openshift|RestEasy Reactive,<br>openshift|Keycloak,<br>OpenShift|
|RBAC with Keycloak and 3Scale on Openshift|In this scenario the server uses a proxied gateway (3Scale) which is responsible for enforcing RBAC.|RestEasy Reactive,<br>RestEasy Client Reactive,<br>oidc-reactive-filter,<br>openshift|RestEasy Reactive,<br>openshift|Keycloak,<br>OpenShift,<br>3Scale|
|RBAC with OpenShift Service Mesh|Client and Server are both managed by OpenShift Service Mesh. The JWT is created outside and enforced by the Service Mesh.|RestEasy Reactive,<br>RestEasy Client Reactive,<br>jwt,<br>openshift|RestEasy Reactive,<br>openshift|Keycloak,<br>OpenShift,<br>Service Mesh|
