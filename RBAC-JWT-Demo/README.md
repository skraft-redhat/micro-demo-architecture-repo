|[RBAC with http Query Headers](https://github.com/skraft-redhat/micro-demo-architecture-repo/tree/main/RBAC-JWT-Demo/1a-BasicAuthentication)|This is the most basic module where the "role" is transferred as a Query Header. The server validates the role programmatically.||RestEasy Reactive,<br>RestEasy Client Reactive|<br>RestEasy Reactive||
|[RBAC with Basic Authentication](https://github.com/skraft-redhat/micro-demo-architecture-repo/tree/main/RBAC-JWT-Demo/1b-Authentication-via-http-header)|The client uses browser-based Basic Authentication. This is then propagated to the Server. |Credentials are stored in a database<br>Credentials are specified in .properties file|RestEasy Reactive,<br>RestEasy Client Reactive<br>For the connection with the database: Hibernate-orm-panache,<br>security-jpa,<br>jdbc-postgresql|RestEasy Reactive<br>For the connection with the database:<br>Hibernate-orm-panache,<br>security-jpa,<br>jdbc-postgresql|External database to store user credentials|
